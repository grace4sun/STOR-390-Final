# STOR 390 Final Paper: Evaluating Virtual Reality Immersion Models and Ethical Implications

This repository hosts five files for the STOR 390 Final Project submission.
- Novel Analysis (RMD and HTML): Contain R code used to conduct the novel analysis portion of this project, in an effort to recreate a proof of the author's methodology.
- Final Paper (RMD and PDF): Contains my final paper text and references.
- VR Data (CSV): Also cited in the references section of my paper, this csv contains the dataset used in the novel analysis.

In their paper, “Immersion Metrics for Virtual Reality”, Matias N. Selzer and Silvia M. Castro outline their methodology for a user study to gather data about the immersive qualities of VR headsets and their subsequent work on developing predictive models for assessing immersion levels. This paper critiques their methods and, through the lens of utilitarianism, argues that despite some concerns, occasional VR use greatly enhances the human experience by providing entertainment, educational value, and mental health treatment support.
